/**
 * Three stores, deliberately separate.
 *
 * Redux holds small durable client state — playback resume position, settings,
 * wants. TanStack Query holds the screens' own queries. The catalog — albums,
 * artists, tracks — holds its own, one record per resource. They have
 * different sizes, different lifetimes and different reasons to be cleared:
 * dropping a stale catalog should never risk a user's settings, and one
 * instance made that a single blast radius.
 *
 * The catalog is separate from the query cache for size rather than for
 * lifetime. The persister rewrites its blob whenever anything in the cache
 * changes, and a catalog inside it made every one of those writes cost the
 * whole library — see `features/library/catalogPersistence`, which owns this
 * store's records.
 *
 * All three live in a namespace of their own for this architecture. Nothing
 * reads the previous namespace: the rewrite changed what every persisted
 * record looks like, so a value carried over would be a value in a shape no
 * reader now understands. Users reconnect and re-sync once, and the old
 * namespace is left untouched so a rollback finds its state exactly as it was.
