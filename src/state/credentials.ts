/**
 * Where secrets live.
 *
 * Passwords, API keys, tokens and session keys go to the platform keystore —
 * Keychain on iOS, the Android Keystore — and never into Redux. Redux is
 * persisted to MMKV as plain JSON: readable on a rooted or jailbroken device,
 * swept up by any state dump, and carried into a crash report by whatever
 * serialises the store. A token stored there is a token disclosed.
 *
 * What Redux keeps is the part that is not secret: which servers exist, which
 * integrations are configured, and the *reference* under which each one's
 * secret is filed. A reference is derived, never stored, so the two can never
 * disagree about where a secret lives.
 *
 * Nothing here logs a value, and nothing returns one except to the caller that
 * asked for it by name.
