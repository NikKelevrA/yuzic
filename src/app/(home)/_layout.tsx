/**
 * The outer authenticated layout: providers, watchers, and the app-wide sync
 * effects. Every browsing route the app can reach after login lives inside
 * `(tabs)`, which owns its own Tabs + per-tab Stack. Detail routes (album,
 * artist, playlist, radio, podcasts, shares, downloads, genres, library
 * collections) live in the shared `(tabs)/(home,search,library)/` group so
 * they push onto the currently-focused tab's stack — the tab bar and
 * PlayingBar stay docked below across the whole browse session.
 *
 * `settings/` deliberately does NOT live in that shared group. Settings is
 * global app configuration, not tab-scoped content, and a shared-group route
 * is compiled once per tab: opening it from Home and again from Library built
 * two independent Settings stacks, each remembering its own sub-page, so the
 * app could hold three at once and returning to a tab restored whichever
 * sub-page that tab had been left on. Here it is one screen on the root
 * stack — a single instance, pushed above the dock, returning to whichever
 * tab opened it with that tab untouched underneath.
 *
 * It is an ordinary push rather than a modal presentation. A push already
 * covers the whole screen including the dock, which is all "modal" was
 * bought for here, and it keeps the screen in the same native view
 * controller as the rest of the app. `presentation: 'modal'` and
 * `'fullScreenModal'` both hand the screen to a separately-presented
 * UIViewController on iOS, where the top safe-area inset arrives as 0 — the
 * header then drew its back arrow level with the status bar clock. Nothing
 * in Settings asks for modal semantics, so the presentation that keeps the
 * insets is the right one.
