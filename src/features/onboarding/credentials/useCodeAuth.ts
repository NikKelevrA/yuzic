 * Drives a code-based sign-in: begin, poll until approved, expire on time.

 * Extracted from the onboarding screen rather than left inline because the
 * interesting part is a state machine with a timer in it, and the house style
 * is to pull that kind of decision out where it can be tested. The screen is
 * then only responsible for rendering whichever phase it is handed.
 *
 * Two details are easy to get wrong and are handled here:
 *
 * - **A poll that throws is not a failure.** The network drops, a proxy
 *   hiccups, the server restarts mid-flow. Each poll is independently
 *   attempted and a thrown one is swallowed, because the next one two seconds
 *   later is likely to succeed and the code has not expired yet. Only the
 *   timeout ends a waiting flow.
 * - **The interval must not outlive the screen.** Polling holds the server URL
 *   and proxy credentials, and an interval that survives unmount keeps hitting
 *   a server for a flow nobody is watching.
