/**
 * The catalog on disk, one record per resource.
 *
 * The catalog used to ride along in the TanStack Query persister's single
 * blob (`PersistQueryClientProvider` in `app/_layout.tsx`), which is what
 * `createAsyncStoragePersister` does by default: every query in the cache,
 * `JSON.stringify`'d to one key, rewritten whenever anything in the cache
 * changes, and `JSON.parse`'d whole before the app can paint.
 *
 * That is affordable for a small library and quadratic in annoyance for a
 * large one, because the *whole* blob is paid for by *any* change. Modelled
 * on the real entity shapes, an 80,000-track library serialises to ~98 MB and
 * a 300,000-track one to ~367 MB — 0.7 s and 3.3 s just to parse, on desktop
 * V8, before Hermes and a phone's memory ceiling are accounted for. Users
 * reported 10 s cold starts at 80k and an untappable UI at 300k, which is
 * that blob being rewritten on a throttle while they tried to scroll.
 *
 * So the catalog lives here instead, in its own MMKV namespace, one record
 * per resource per server:
 *
 * - **A sync writes only what it fetched.** Six small writes on a sync
 *   replace one enormous write per second of playback.
 * - **A start reads each resource separately**, after first paint, cheapest
 *   first — see `useCatalogHydration`. The tracks list is the whale and lands
 *   last, so nothing else waits behind it.
 * - **Everything else still rides the blob**, which is now small: it holds
 *   the screens' own queries, not the library.
 *
 * What this deliberately does *not* change is where the catalog lives at
 * runtime. It is still one array per resource in the query cache, read
 * through the same keys by the same hooks, so `useAlbums`'s "the persisted
 * cache is the offline story" is still true — only the shape on disk moved.
 * A library too big to hold in memory at all needs paged reads, which is a
 * different and much larger change; this one makes the common case fast
 * without touching a single call site.
