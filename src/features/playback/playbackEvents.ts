 * not the tracks. Moving on past that point was not recovery: it dropped each
 * track from the queue in turn, and Autoplay refilled it, so a server whose

 * This is the other half — carrying the decision out — and it is the half that
 * has to touch the player, the queue and the toast.
 *
 * The two were previously one ninety-line closure inside the provider, with
 * its three pieces of memory living as provider refs among forty others.
 * Those three exist only for this, so they live here now as closure state,
 * where nothing else can reach them and their lifetime is the handler's.
 *
 * **Why a stall resumes rather than restarts.** A failure fifty-seven seconds
 * into a track is a stream that stalled, not a track that cannot be played,
 * and the two want opposite responses. Restarting a stalled track is what made
 * the same minute of a song play twice before the track was dropped as
 * unplayable — the symptom a listener describes as the song not playing
 * through.
