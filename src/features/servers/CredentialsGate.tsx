/**
 * Nothing that can talk to a server renders before its secrets are loaded.
 *
 * Secrets live in the platform keystore and are read once at launch into
 * `credentialCache` — every scope each server owns (`serverCredentialScopes`).
 * The app used to render while that read was in flight, so everything that
 * mounted first asked its server with an empty password. The
 * server refused; a Subsonic refusal arrived as 200 OK, and with the catalog
 * under `staleTime: Infinity` a cold start could leave Albums, Tracks and
 * Artists empty for good. Sixty-odd components reach a server through
 * `useApi`, so no per-query guard could close that window — this does, once.
 *
 * The read is local and quick, and the splash screen stays up for it. It
 * ends in `finally`, so a keystore failure still opens the app — as signed
 * out, which is what a server with no readable secrets is.
 *
 * Runs after `PersistGate`, which is what makes the server list it reads
 * reliable at this point.
