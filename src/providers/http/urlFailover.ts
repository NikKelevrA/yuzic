 * extras; primary + fallbacks are tried in order, and the last known-good URL
 * is cached per server so subsequent requests skip straight to it.
 *
 * This module is deliberately fetch-agnostic — it takes a "try one URL" async
 * probe and returns whichever URL that probe resolves against, so tests can
 * exercise the failover logic without any network mocking.
