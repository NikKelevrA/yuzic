/**
 * What an address probe can conclude, and how it reads a thrown fetch.

 * The three probes (Subsonic, Jellyfin/Emby, Plex) each ask their server's
 * public endpoint and each have to answer the same question, so the shape of
 * the answer and the one judgement call in it live here rather than three
 * times over.
 *
 * The judgement call is `certificateRejected`. A probe only ever sees a
 * thrown fetch, and every reason it might throw used to collapse into
 * `unreachable`: nothing listening, wrong port, DNS miss, and a certificate
 * the device refused all produced "Couldn't reach a server at this address."
 * That last one is not a wrong address, and telling the user to check the
 * address is advice that cannot work — on Android a private CA is refused
 * however right the address is, because the platform ignores user-installed
 * roots unless the app opts in (see `plugins/withUserCaTrust.js`). Someone
 * hitting this had no way to learn what was actually wrong.

 *   found` — the Caddy-internal-CA case in full.
 * - iOS reports NSURLErrorServerCertificateUntrusted as "The certificate for
