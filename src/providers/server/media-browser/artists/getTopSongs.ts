/**
 * An artist's most-played songs, as this server knows them.
 *
 * A weaker claim than Subsonic's `getTopSongs.view`, and deliberately a
 * different one: Subsonic is backed by Last.fm playcounts, so it ranks the
 * artist's records the way the world plays them. MediaBrowser has no such
 * graph — `PlayCount` lives in per-user data — so what comes back here is
 * what *this account* has played most. The contract has always said so; it
 * simply had no implementation behind it on Jellyfin and Emby until now.
 *
 * Zero-play tracks are dropped rather than returned in whatever order the
 * server happened to sort them. `SortBy=PlayCount` on a library nobody has
 * played yet is a list with no ranking in it at all, and the section that
 * reads this hides itself on an empty result — which is the honest outcome
 * for an account with nothing to rank.
